    <h1>Elementary Logic: Chapter 4 Solutions</h1>
    <p>
      In all of the exercises that follow, when asked to give an interpretation,
      I have taken the liberty to assign denotations only to the non-logical
      constants that appear in the sentences under consideration.  As you might
      remember, Mates defines an interpretation such that all of the
      non-logical constants of <b>L</b> are assigned denotations.

      <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
      <p>
	Let &psi; be any sentence, and let -&phi; be a valid sentence.  -&phi;
	is true under every interpretation since it is valid.  It follows that
	&phi; must be false under every interpretation since it is the negation
	of -&phi;.  Clearly, there can be no interpretation under which &phi;
	is true and &psi; is false, since &phi; can not be true under any
	interpretation.  Therefore, &psi; is a consequence of &phi; and since
	&psi; can be any sentence at all, every sentence is a consequence of
	&phi;.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ex2">
      <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
      <p>
	Let &theta; be any sentence, and suppose {&phi;,&psi;} is a set of
	inconsistant sentences.  There is no interpretation for which both &phi;
	and &psi; are true since they are inconsistant.  Clearly, there can be
	no interpretation for which both &phi; and &psi; are true and &theta; is
	false since &phi; and &psi; are both true under no interpretation.
	Therefore, &theta; is a consequence of {&phi;,&psi;}, and since &theta;
	can be any sentence, every sentence is a consequence of {&phi;,&psi;}.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ex3">
      <h2>Exercise 3</h2>
      <p>
	Let &Gamma; be any set of sentences and &phi; be a valid sentence.
	&phi; is true under every interpretations since it is valid.  Trivially,
	&phi; is false under no interpretations.  Clearly, there is no
	interpretation under which all the sentences of &Gamma; are true and
	&phi; is false since &phi; is false under no interpretations.
	Therefore, &phi; is a consequence of &Gamma; and since &Gamma; can be
	any set of sentences, &phi; is a consequence of every set of sentences.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ex4">
      <h2>Exercise 4</h2>
      <p>
	Let &phi; and &psi; be sentences.  &psi; is a consequence of &phi; if
	and only if there is no interpretation under which &phi; is true and
	&psi; is false.  This holds if and only if there is no interpretation
	under which (&phi; &rarr; &psi;) is false.  Said another way, this
	holds if and only if (&phi; &rarr; &psi;) is true under every
	interpretation.  Therefore, &psi; is a consequence of &phi; if and only
	if (&phi; &rarr; &psi;) is valid.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="ex5">
      <h2>Exercise 5</h2>
      <p>
	If -&phi; is a valid sentence then -&phi; is true under every
	interpretation and &phi; is false under every interpretation.  Said
	another way, there is no interpretation under which &phi; is true.
	Therefore, there is no interpretation under which all the sentences of
	{&phi;} are true so, &phi; is inconsistant with itself (and with any
	other set of sentences it is included in).

    <div id="ex8">
      <h2>Exercise 8</h2>
      <p>
	In short, because they are both valid sentences.  In the case of (6),
	for the sentence to be false, <i>F</i><sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub><i>a</i>
	must be false and (<i>x</i>)<i>F</i><sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub><i>x</i>
	must be true.  However, the latter implies that the former is true, 
	since if <i>F</i><sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub> holds fonr every member in the
	domain, it certainly holds for one particular member.  Therefore,
	there can be no interpretation under which the sentence is false, which
	means it's valid.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the case of (10), let <b>I</b> be any interpretation and let &beta;
	be any individual constant in the domain of <b>I</b>.  Trivially,
	<i>F</i><sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub><i>&beta;</i>&or;
	-<i>F</i><sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub><i>&beta;</i> is true under <b>I</b>.
	Since &beta; can be any any individual constant, this holds for every
	individual constant of <b>I</b>, and since <b>I</b> can be any
	interpretation, (10) is valid.

	For the sentence to be false, the sentences
	(<i>P</i> &rarr; <i>Q</i>) and (<i>Q</i> &rarr; <i>R</i>) must both be
	false.  If the former is false, then P must be true and Q must be false.
	However if Q is false, (<i>Q</i> &rarr; <i>R</i>) is always true; and
	therefore the disjunction can never be false under any interpretation.
